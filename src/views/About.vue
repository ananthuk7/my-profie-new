        I'm a web developer, graphics designer and UI/UX designer. I love to
        solve design problems, develop new features and design prototypes using
        different mediums. My work is mainly focused on frontend-development. As
        for graphic designs, my work mainly involves photo manipulation.
        Besides, I also like doing photography and videography, where I can
        express my creative thought process.
