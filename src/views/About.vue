        I'm a web developer and UI/UX developer. I love to solve design
        problems, develop new features and design prototypes using different
        mediums. My work is mainly focused on frontend-development. As for
        graphic designs, my work mainly involves photo manipulation. Besides, I
        also like doing photography and videography, where I can express my
        creative thought process.
